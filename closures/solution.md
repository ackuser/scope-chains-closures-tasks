# Almost there!

Check the errors above to see where you went wrong.

# Hints

  * The task is to return the function `zip`, not the result of `zip()`.
  * The value you set to `bar` isn't important.

  Awesome stuff - you closed over the variable bar inside zip, then returned
  zip.



  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Solution

  Let's look at the scope chain for your solution:

        foo()
       var bar
      return zip
          â†‘
          |
        zip()
      bar = true

  By referencing bar within zip, we have created a Closure where zip() closes over the variable bar from its parent scope foo().

  Since we are returning the function zip, the reference to bar is maintained (and hence the closure is maintained) until zip is no longer required.

  This has interesting implications for memory, which we will cover in the next lesson.
